    <h2><em>Don't miso out on this seabass</em></h2>
        <p>This Sea Bass will melt in your mouth! I cannot seem to forget about this seabass since I first had a taste on my flight to Shanghai. And I thought if it's this good on an airplane, it must be even better in my kitchen. I was right! I found this recipe to be even more delicious than what I had on the plane. If you follow this recipe, you will not be dissapointed.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>    
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup sake</li>
        <li>⅓ cup mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)</li>
        <li>¼ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup miso paste</li>
        <li>4 (4 ounce) fillets fresh sea bass, about 1 inch thick</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped scallions</li>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together the sake, mirin, soy sauce, brown sugar, and miso paste in a bowl to make the marinade. Place the sea bass in a large sealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over the sea bass. Chill in refrigerator 3 to 6 hours. Arrange the fillets on a baking sheet. Discard the marinade.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Prop the oven door to remain slightly ajar.
            <li>Bake the sea bass under the broiler until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 9 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped green onions to serve.
